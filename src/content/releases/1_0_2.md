Hello, Loyal Board Dashers! We have some exciting new features for you:

### üçø New Features & Enhancements

- **Motor Pool Beta open for testing:** Manage your motor pool with ease! Book and reserve now! Missing some requirments? No problem, we have documents, tests, and forms you need to get you up and running at breakneck speed! (Speed is for getting a reservation only, not driving - just saying).
- **Access Control** app_users.iAppRoleId of 105 (fr only) redirects to facilities requests submit page 100% of the time now. Currenly for those users that is the only page they can access. This is by design.
